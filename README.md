# NeuralNetwork
A Neural Network to recognise handwritten digits

# Neural Network From Scratch
To understand how a Neuralnetwork works i code a NeuralNetwork with just numpy no libraries like tensorflow.

# Neural Network Drawning Game
Here i used tensorflow combined with a pygame window to draw digits my self and make it predict what i was drawing. 
Both networks are train on MNIST handwritting digits.
